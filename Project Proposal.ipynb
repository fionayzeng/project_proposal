    "Academic success is often determined by an individual’s performance on exams. While there are many factors that can influence exam performance, it is widely believed that studying is one of the most important. There is a present stigma that individuals who spend more time studying will perform better on exams than those who don’t study at all. However, the exact relationship between studying and exam performance is not well understood.    \n",
